# To Do List
Welcome to my web app. Thats my second work, but its still new for me making an app. And its still way to go :)


## Installation
Firstly make sure that you have latest version of browser installed. 
Next clone this repo https://github.com/RuslanBednyakov/To-Do-List.git. You can do this by going into your shell of choice and entering
```
git clone https://github.com/RuslanBednyakov/To-Do-List.git
```
then change into that folder

## Contribute
I'll be very happy for any input and potential contributions for this project.

Firstly raise an issue. Then if you are assigned to that issue fork the repo, make your edits and make a pull request.

I hope you enjoy my first work :)
